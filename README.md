Still tinkering with this cookbook, adding features and functionality as time
permits.  Pull requests welcome.

Cookbook to install [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) with
[Nginx](http://nginx.org/) and
[PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php).  This cookbook aims to
leverage as many [opscode community
cookbooks](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks) as possible.
