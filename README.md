===========

Still tinkering.  Doing dev with rackspace-vagrant.

Cookbook to install [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) with
[Nginx](http://nginx.org/) and
[PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php).  This cookbook aims to
leverage as many [opscode community
cookbooks](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks) as possible.

TODO
====
Still tinkering with this cookbook, adding features and functionality as time
permits.  This cookbook is not yet production ready.

* Need to fix memcache sessions setup
* Add admin user via cookbook
* Flush out documentation
* Setup build tests
